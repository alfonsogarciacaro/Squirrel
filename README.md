<p>
Squirrel is a simple and easy to use interfaces for querying and reporting of data. APIs for Data acquisition, Data filtering, Data cleansing, etc. provide simple solution, often in one step, for many real world problems.

Dependency
----
There is a dependency for [NCalc](https://ncalc.codeplex.com/) for AddColumn() method. 

Example #1 (Do women pay more tip than men?)
------
***data*** for this example is available at ***../Data/tips.csv***

The data from which this analytics has to be calculated is available in tips.csv file and first few rows of that file looks like this 
<img src="http://gifyu.com/images/tips.gif" border="0">
Here is how you can use Squirrel to find an answer to that question
<!--<img src="http://gifyu.com/images/tips_final.gif"/>-->
```csharp
//Problem : Locate average percentage of Tip paid by men and women from tips.csv
//Done in 3 lines of C# code using Squirrel.NET
 
 
//Loading the data to Squirrel.NET Table is easy
Table tips = DataAcquisition.LoadCSV(@"..\..\tips.csv");
 
//Add a new column based on the formula
tips.AddColumn(columnName: "tip%", formula: "[tip]*100/[totbill]", decimalDigits: 3);
 
tips
//Pick only these columns
.Pick("sex", "tip%")
//Aggregate the Tip% values by calculating the average
.Aggregate("sex", AggregationMethod.Average)
//Round off the result till 2 decimal points
.RoundOffTo(2)
//Dump the result to console.
.PrettyDump(); 
```

Example #2 (Iris dataset aggregation)
-----
***data*** for this example is available at ***../Data/iris.csv***

<p> The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher (1936) as an example of discriminant analysis.It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species.[2] Two of the three species were collected in the Gasp√© Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus". ]---- Taken from Wikipedia </p>

<p>A botanist might want to find several aggregation reports from this dataset</p>


<img src="http://gifyu.com/images/iris.gif" border="0">

Here is the code that uses Squirrel to address these requirements.
```csharp
Table iris = DataAcquisition.LoadCSV(@"iris.csv");
StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
 
builder.AppendLine("<html>");
 
builder.AppendLine("<h2>Range</h2>");
builder.AppendLine(iris.Aggregate("Name", AggregationMethod.Range).ToHTMLTable());
 
builder.AppendLine("<h2>Average</h2>");
builder.AppendLine(iris.Aggregate("Name", AggregationMethod.Average).ToHTMLTable());
 
builder.AppendLine("<h2>Max</h2>");
builder.AppendLine(iris.Aggregate("Name", AggregationMethod.Max).ToHTMLTable());
 
builder.AppendLine("<h2>Min</h2>");
builder.AppendLine(iris.Aggregate("Name", AggregationMethod.Min).ToHTMLTable());
 
builder.AppendLine("</html>");
StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter("temp.html");
writer.WriteLine(builder.ToString());
writer.Close();
 
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("temp.html"); 
```

Example #3 (Finding Gender-Ratio statistics in North America)
----
***data*** for this example is available at ***../Data/births.csv***

<p>Gender Ratio is an important sociological index to gauge the growth of a nation. The following data (only a few are shown here) is a list of "boy" and "girl" birth statistics for different states across North America. The data analysis task a sociologist might be interested to do is to find gender-ratio of North America for different states</p>

<p>The following C# code achieves this using Squirrel</p>
<img src="http://gifyu.com/images/births.gif" border="0">
```csharp
 Table births = DataAcquisition.LoadCSV(@"..\..\births.csv");
var splits = births.SplitOn("sex");
 
var boys = splits["boy"].Aggregate("state").Drop("year");
var girls = splits["girl"].Aggregate("state").Drop("year");
 
Table combined = new Table();
 
combined.AddColumn("State", boys["state"]);
combined.AddColumn("Boys", boys["births"]);
combined.AddColumn("Girls", girls["births"]);
combined.AddColumn("Difference", "[Boys]-[Girls]", 4);
combined.AddColumn("GenderRatio", "[Girls]/[Boys]", 4);
//Showing 5 stats with lowest gender ratio at the end of 2006.
string tab = combined.Pick("State", "GenderRatio")
.SortBy("GenderRatio")
.Top(5)
.ToBasicBootstrapHTMLTable(BootstrapTableDecorators.BootstrapTableClasses.Table_Striped);
 
StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter("temp.htm");
sw.WriteLine("<html><h2>Gender Ratio in North America by the end of 2006</h2>" + tab + "</html>");
sw.Close();
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("temp.htm"); 
```

This produces the following result

API Overview
------------
1. **BasicStatistics** - Basic statistical functions like Median, Range, Standard Deviation, Kurtosis, etc.
2. **CustomComparers** - Several customized comparators for sorting data.
3. **DataAcqusition** - Data loaded/dumped from/to various formats, e.g. CSV, TSV, HTML, ARFF, etc.
4. **RelationalDatabaseConnectors** - Data can be loaded from popular relationl DB repositories
5. **DataCleansers** - Extraction/Removal of outliers or data that matches specific boolean criteria.
6. **OrderedTable** - A data structure to hold sort results temporarily.
7. **Story** - Creating automatic dashboard components from a table instance. 
8. **Table** - An ubiquitous data structure used to encapsulate the data. Several APIs are part of the *Table* -
.  Filter data using regular expressions or SQL clause.
* Sort data based on columns and their values.
* Programmatic manipulation i.e. deletion, updation and insertion of data.
* Merge data columns; Find subsets and exclusive or common rows in tables.
